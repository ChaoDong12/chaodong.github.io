I am currently a Research Associate at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/), affiliated with [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/). My research focuses on dementia diagnosis using machine learning. With a multidisciplinary approach combining biomedical engineering, neuroimaging, neuroscience, and machine learning techniques, my research aims to deepen our understanding of human longevity mechanics, ageing-related diseases, genetic determinants of brain structure, and the identification of reliable brain ageing or dementia biomarkers.

I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in Biomedical Engineering before obtaining my PhD in Psychiatry from the [University of New South Wales (UNSW)](https://www.cheba.unsw.edu.au/). in 2024, supported by the prestigious Scientia PhD Scholarship. During my time at the [Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA)](https://www.cheba.unsw.edu.au/blog/chao-dong-meet-our-researcher-series) at UNSW, I conducted research under the guidance of my supervisors: [Wei Wen](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=j-m4_E8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Karen A. Mather](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=yQurwtYAAAAJ&hl=en), [Anbupalam Thalamuthu](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=QPcKQVMAAAAJ&hl=en), [Perminder S. Sachdev](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=joXgLDoAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Jiyang Jiang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=rLJeyIIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
